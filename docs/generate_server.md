# Generate server.dart

[Back to README](../README.md)

The Dart `build_runner` tool generates `bin/server.dart`, the main entry point
for the function server app, which invokes the function in `lib/functions.dart`.

Run the `build_runner` tool, as shown here:

```shell
$ dart run build_runner build
